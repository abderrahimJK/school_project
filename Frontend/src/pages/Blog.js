            <p> The idea of name/value pairs is used in both HTML and CSS. In HTML, an attribute is like a property; different
                attributes have different names, and each attribute can have a value. Similarly, in CSS you can change the color
                of a heading by creating a rule that gives the col or property a specific value, or you can change the typeface it is
                written in by giving the font-family property a specific value. Name/value pairs are used a lot in programming. </p>
